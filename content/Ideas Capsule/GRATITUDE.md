Often you hear about the benefits from the practice of gratitude, especially reflecting on what you’re grateful for – but this Huberman Lab podcast on the science of gratitude really reframed my ideas of gratitude. According to science, there’s greater health effects if you’re on the receiving end of gratitude, which led me to the belief that I aim to live in a way that brings value to others, and they’d feel lucky to have me in their lives as I do them. In what ways, can I serve others and contribute to some cause? Admittedly, this has not been top of mind in how I’ve lived my life recently, but I hope to anchor myself in this bidirectional gratitude as I continue to live life.
