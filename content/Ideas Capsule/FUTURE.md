Learning about the difference of [resume vs. eulogy virtues](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/david-brooks-the-moral-bucket-list.html) – I’m motivated to live a life that is framed by what my obituary will say. This does not negate the deeds done without anyone’s knowledge except for mine. I want to be warm, caring, inviting, compassionate, resourceful, generous, trustworthy, optimistic, vocal, engaged, civic-minded, inspiring, earnest and virtuous. Of course this is not an exhaustive list. 

As you might want to be the pillar of support to others, I hope to build on your efforts and serve as the bridge . Just as you want to set people on their respective right paths, I also believe in cultivating the agency of others.

While I love my mom (and feel ambivalently towards my dad, whom my respect has become eroded), I believe my approach to motherhood will be significantly different. Like my mom, I intend to raise high-agency kids, but more than my mom, I wish to be an active part of my children’s learning process. As life-long learners, I want to inspire my children with curiosity and wonder as I’m lucky to have the opportunity to do so through the democratization of knowledge on the Internet. I hope to be the parent who my children’s friends would feel safe to confide in. I want the respect of my children but I want them to develop the wit and discernment to call me out on my bullshit, hypocrisy, and insensitivity.
