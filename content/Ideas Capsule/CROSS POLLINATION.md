As we coalesce and collide with broadly learned people – I aspire to cross-pollinate between ideas and people. Beyond serendipity, I want to systematically unite human resources, ingenuity, and passions to drive collective progress. I love the idea of being the person to bring together two ideas or people, and creating the spark with immense potential.

One of the reasons why the public sector appeals to me so much is the desire for people to share opportunities with one another in order to retain the talent dedicated to public good. I’ve always believed in paying it forward by sharing opportunities and connecting people with one another and with resources. What I think of as cross-pollination is the relational approach to how I engage, which grounds systems-level work in community care, mentorship, and collective capacity-building.
