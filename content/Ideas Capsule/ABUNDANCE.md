I live a life of abundance, of which I am eternally grateful for. Growing up in NYC, I had so many opportunities to engage with people and expand my views. With the abundance, I developed resourcefulness to seek out these opportunities (in high school, I even compiled and circulated a 70 page Google Doc of programs, scholarships, awards, and opportunities). I love knowing the landscape of opportunities and being very familiar – but finding a new opportunity is rewarding too. I also believe in the abundance of people – that are infinitely many awesome people out there, and I can choose to get to know them as they come into my life. And, of course in the recent political discourse, I support abundance politics – I believe that our world is capable of producing abundance, and it should make essential goods abundant (though I’m critical of over production at the expense of the environment).
