I’d characterize myself as a shameless person, as someone with high tolerance for awkwardness, embarrassment, cringe and rejection. In high school, I felt like I toned down my personality; I didn;t bother engaging with people in my high school (initially I did, then I lost interest and curiosity towards the people around me). Then, I realized that people are not thinking about me as an individual since they’re preoccupied with their own life. Therefore, even if I do something embarrassing, most people won’t care to remember. That was a liberating realization. So, now I often hold the mentality of “idgaf”. In recent months, I’ve realized that shame is a mechanism that is necessary, and therefore I ought to recalibrate. As someone who intends to work in public service and public life, I should care about my image and dignity more than I previously believed. I still believe in living boldly and authentically. Luckily for me, I’m very comfortable with myself, and not only do I love myself as a human being, I also like myself! I’d want to be friends with myself because I know the amount of care I have towards people who have earned it in my life.
