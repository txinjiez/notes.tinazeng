Hi! 

I’m Tina Zeng. You’ve landed on my corner of the web—and, by extension, a few sulci of my noggin that I’ve decided to make readable.
  
This site is a capsule of ideas I’ve been inspired by, borrowed and adapted from others, and introspected and carried with me over the past five years.
  
If you’d like to learn more about me, visit: [https://tinazeng.me/about](https://tinazeng.me/about)
